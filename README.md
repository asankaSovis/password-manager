        NOTICE:
        I am currently also porting Muragala to a C# library. Once it's done, I also plan to turn
        it into a GUI Application. I will continue to improve the Python repo as well and it
        will continue to act as the main place for testing the ideas and improvements.

Muragala is a password manager designed to make managing passwords easy and secure. My goal is to make it a secure and reliable password manager available in the public domain for everyone to use. Privacy and security is for everyone, this is the core value behind this project. It uses [Fernet encryption](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) to encrypt passwords and store them on a database. It uses two factor authentication with a password and randomly generated salt to encrypt the database. The application is built to be as simple as possible to make sure it's secure. On the other hand, this project is an experiment to see how to make a better security application.

Please note that I am still learning and this project has also been a way to expand my knowledge. Any suggestions, issues and ideas are more than welcome. On the other hand, this application is still in its alpha phase. Therefore please don't use it solely for personal usage. It might have severe bugs and issues regarding functionality and security.

## Dependencies
- [Cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) - This module is used for all the cryptographic work. This is an important library.
- [Pyperclip](https://pyperclip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - This module is only used for copying content to the clipboard. Can be skipped if not necessary.

## Setup
Go to the [Releases](#releases) section. Pick a prefered release and download it. Unpack the zip file. Optionally, you can hash the password-manager.py file on a service and compare it with the provided hashes to validate. Make sure that the help.txt file is in the right place as well *(In the same folder)*. If you don't have python installed, you can install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once done, open the command prompt or terminal. Install the cryptography module using the following command.

    pip install cryptography

Additionally, you can also install the pyperclip library as well. This is optional but the copy command will not work if you opt out.

    pip install pyperclip

Now you double click on the password-manager.py or run it from command prompt itself. *Enjoy!* Make sure to give feedback.

## Initial Setup
On opening the application for the first time, the application will create the database and preference file. This includes setting  up the salt, which requires your password. As soon as you open up for the first time, it will ask for a password. Provide a prefered password. **Make sure to remember this as it is what keeps the data protected.** Once done, you will be loaded into the application. Now you can continue to use it. Optionally, you can also backup the preference.en file created in the same directory in case of an emergency.

*NOTE: The salt or password alone cannot be used to recover the data in the database. Make sure to preserve both. Also note that the application is still in the Alpha phase.*

## Usage
The application has several useful commands built in. These allow for adding, editing, deleting and also viewing passwords to and from the database.
- ‚ùì help - This command will list out help information for the application.
  - `help`    [List out all the commands and their details]
  - `help <command>`  [This will list out information for the specified command]
- ‚õî exit - This command will exit the application.
- ‚ùó about - This command will show the about information of the application.
- üïì version - This command will show the version number of the application that you're using.
- ‚ûï add - This command will add a new profile to the database.
  - `add`    [Loads the add command with auto-generated password of default size and character set]
  - `add <size> <arguements>`    [Loads the add command with auto-generated password of size provided and character set provided]
  - `add -m`    [Loads the add command with a manual password]
      > arguement set - -u(Include uppercase) -n(Include numbers) -c(Include special characters)
      > 
      > *ex: 'add 13 -c -u' will auto-generate a password 13 characters long with only lowercase, uppercase and special characters*
- ‚úèÔ∏è edit - This command will edit an existing profile in the database.
  - `edit <platform> <username>`    [Loads the edit command with auto-generated password of default size and character set for the provided platform and username]
  - `edit <platform> <username> <size> <arguements>`    [Loads the edit command with auto-generated password of size provided and character set provided]
  - `edit <platform> <username> -m`    [Loads the edit command with a manual password]
      > arguement set - -u(Include uppercase) -n(Include numbers) -c(Include special characters)
      > 
      > *ex: 'edit Instagram Frank 13 -c -u' will auto-generate a password 13 characters long with only lowercase, uppercase and special characters*
- üóëÔ∏è delete - This command will delete an existing profile in the database.
  - `delete <platform> <username>`    [Loads the delete command for the platform and username]
- üëÄ show - This command will show the password of an existing profile in the database.
  - `show <platform> <username>`    [Loads the show command for the platform and username]
- üóíÔ∏è copy - This command will copy the password of an existing profile in the database.
  - `copy <platform> <username>`    [Loads the copy command for the platform and username]
- üåè platform - This command will list out the platforms in the database.
  - `platform`    [Will list all the platforms listed in the database]
  - `platform <keyword>`    [Will list all the platforms listed in the database that match the keyword]
  - `platform <keyword> <row>`    [Will list all the platforms listed in the database that match the keyword and will list them in the specified row count]
- üë©‚Äçü¶∞ username - This command will list out the usernames in the database.
  - `username`    [Will list all the usernames listed in the database]
  - `username <keyword>`    [Will list all the usernames listed in the database that match the keyword]
  - `username <keyword> <platform>`    [Will list all the usernames listed in the database that match the keyword and platform name]
  - `username -a <platform>`    [Will list all the usernames listed in the database that match only the platform name]
  - `username <keyword or -a> <platform> <rows>`    [Will list all the usernames listed in the database that match the keyword (or all if -a is provided) and platform name and will list them in the specified row count]

## Implementation
The database is a basic text file and data is stored to it in JSON format. However, each item is stored as an encrypted string, encrypted using the Fernet encryption.

![database_structure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46389631/149176881-a137705f-0d34-4845-a72d-d3b02b7c2fd3.png)

`{"Platform 01" : [{"User 01" : ["Password", "Modified Date"]}, ...], ...}`

Each of these parameters are encrypted individually. Fernet encryption requires a salt and password to decrypt. Thus, we can modify the password to store different items in different formats.
